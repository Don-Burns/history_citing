This scale of dispersal leads to considerable opportunities for connectivity through mid-water dispersal. A stable pattern of five regions of biophysical connectivity was obtained for PLDs of 100\\u202fd or more. Connectivity barriers between these regions can persist even when planktonic larval duration extends beyond 200\\u202fd. For a 50\\u202fd PLD, one connectivity barrier coincides with the region of the genetic hybrid zone for northern and southern vent mussel species at the Broken Spur vent field. Additional barriers suggest potential for genetic differentiation that so far has not been detected for any taxon.
